Note that the functionality that interests me within this project has been
transfered to imageLabel (https://github.com/Joelgranados/imagelabel).  I'll
keep this code here just in case I need to port more logic into other projects.
I'm not maintaining this at all.

If you have the opencv library and a standard linux installation `make` should
work.
