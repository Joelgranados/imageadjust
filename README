Note that the functionality that interests me within this project has been
transfered to imageLabel (https://github.com/Joelgranados/imagelabel).  I'll
keep this code here just in case I need to port more logic into other projects.
I'm not maintaining this at all.

If you have the opencv library and a standard linux installation `make` should
work.

`make test` will probably fail as you might not have the test.avi file in the
current directory. And even if you did you might not have filmed the same
chessboard that I have.  It is a good starting point for the use of the command
though.

BUGS:
Checkou the TODO file for any outstanding issues.
Report any bugs to jogr@itu.dk or joel.granados@gmail.com
